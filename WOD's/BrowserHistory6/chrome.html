<p>Google’s Eric Schmidt opposed the development of an independent web browser for six years. He stated that “at the time, Google was a small company,” and he did not want to go through “bruising browser wars.” After co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired several Mozilla Firefox developers and built a demonstration of Chrome, however, Schmidt admitted that “It was so good that it essentially forced me to change my mind.”</p>

<p>In December 2010 Google announced that to make it easier for businesses to use Chrome they would provide an official Chrome MSI package <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome"> Chrome </a>. For business use it is helpful to have full-fledged MSI packages that can be customized via transform files (.mst) - but the MSI provided with Chrome is only a very limited MSI wrapper fitted around the normal installer, and many businesses find that this arrangement does not meet their needs.</p>
