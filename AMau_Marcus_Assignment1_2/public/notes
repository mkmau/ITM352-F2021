is there a way I can take the values from the textbox using checkQuantitytextbox? I know I can then take that value and assign it to total_sold which will then make my site work. 
I tried to do "var quantityremaining = products_array[i].quantity_available - products_array[i].quantity_available;" which worked

if (typeof POST['submitPurchase'] != 'undefined') { 
        var hasvalidquantities=true; // this is to make sure quantity is valid
        var hasquantities=false; 
        var total_sold = 1
        for (i = 0; i < products.length; i++) { //for loop to go through the products and check which one was bought
            var quantityremaining = products_array[i].quantity_available - products_array[i].total_sold; // Deduct quantity from inventory
                qty=POST[`quantity${i}`];
                hasquantities=hasquantities || qty>0; // If it has a value bigger than 0 then it is good
                hasvalidquantities=hasvalidquantities && isNonNegInt(qty);    // if it is both a quantity over 0 and is valid    
} 

for the products_array[i].yyy will it work for total_sold? it works for quantity_available because thats in the array. But total_sold isn't so how does that work?
